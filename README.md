# FRED (Flutter Realtime Entity Detection) A test project integrating TensorflowLite into App Development using Flutter

### My personal venture into applying computer vision and object detection into a handheld package.

### I have always curious about the various ways in which AI could be integrated into our daily tediums, especially the use of realtime object detection by which I am always intrigued. 

### Having gotten my feet wet into app development using Flutter, here is my own take on implementing a realtime object detection android app, with reference from various open source online articles doing the same thing. Overall, was very amazed and will defnitely post more updates about this in the future, fine-tuning this app to be my very own.
